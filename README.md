# Using Bootstrap Themes to Style Your Rails App

## Introduction

_"Style is a way to say who you are without having to speak."_
– Rachel Zoe

As a developer, I sometimes find myself wanting to integrate a preexisting themes into my web applications. But the Rails asset pipeline can make the setup of these themes tricky. So, when I utilize Bootstrap themes, I tend to follow a specific progression in order to get my fancy themes up and running.

Let's take a look at this process, using the Rival theme from the WrapBootstrap marketplace.

## Requiring Dependencies

In order to use components from a theme, we'll need to successfully require all of the themes assets in the `vendor/assets/stylesheets` and `vendor/assets/javascripts` folders. Let's take a look at our theme in the browser:

For this post, we'll use an unstyled Cat App, and I'd love to grab this sortable gallery for my kittens. If we right-click on the theme page, we can view the page source.

### CSS Dependencies

We're going to want to grab the CSS and Javascript files from the theme and require them __in the correct order__ in the Rails application. Let's start with the CSS files – we'll want to copy and paste the `link` tags into a new document in our text editor.

![CSS Files](http://i.imgur.com/VZ8xgUN.png)

From there, let's modify the link tags paths to fit the CSS [Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) format, as demonstrated below. Not that the CSS Sprockets `require` does _not_ include the `.css` extension.

Now, we'll copy and paste the Sprockets into our `application.css` file.

The last step is to ensure that all of the theme's CSS files are included locally in the `vendor/assets/stylesheets` folder. In Rival, we'll copy every file from `Site/assets/css`, as well as `Site/assets/boostrap/css/bootstrap.min.css`, into our `vendor/assets/stylesheets` folder. This will be different for each Bootstrap theme.

### Javascript Dependencies

We'll want to follow the same process for our Javascript `script` tags. Let's copy them into a new document.

![JS Files](http://i.imgur.com/U9HkOGU.png)

One thing that I immediately notice is that one of the `script` tags links to an external resource, not a local file. I don't know what to do with it yet, so we'll deal with it later. Note that JS Sprockets __do__ include the `.js` extension.

Like last time, we'll copy and paste the Sprockets into our `application.js` file.

![JS Sprockets 2](http://i.imgur.com/LBzkzyL.png)

This time, we'll copy every file from `Site/assets/js`, as well as `Site/assets/boostrap/js/bootstrap.min.js`, into our `vendor/assets/javascripts` folder. Now, if we look at the Javascript console, we get an error regarding the Google Maps API script that we skipped over before.

You've got to be kitten me!

![JS Google Error](http://i.imgur.com/LkqSMnV.png)

There's no way to require external resources with Sprockets, so let's add a `javascript_include_tag` to our `application.html.erb` file.

Now our kittens have no errors in the Javascript console! What a happy meow-ment!

## Integrating Components

### Portfolio

Now that all of our dependencies have been required, we can start grabbing some claw-some components from the Bootstrap theme. If we Inspect Element for the portfolio, we can find the start of the portfolio code. We'll copy the line `<section class="module">`, and our clipboard will contain all of the code between the start and end of the `section` element.

![Grab Portfolio](http://i.imgur.com/FgN3XV0.png)

Let's paste that into a new document. Now, we have to decide which bits of that code we want to integrate into our Rails views, and, more speficially, what needs to be dynamic. We'll want a portfolio item for each of our cat items, so let's copy the list items code.

Now, let's paste that into an ERB `each` loop:

![ERB](http://i.imgur.com/3Jk5RZn.png)

We know that whenever we have `li` elements, we'll want a `ul` element to wrap the list items, so we'll grab that `ul` element, as well as the `section` and container `div`, from the theme code, and paste them before our ERB `@cats.each` loop.

![ERB Header](http://i.imgur.com/v4XxQKK.png)

And we'll close the `ul`, `div`, and `section` tags after our ERB `end` – bonus points _fur_ spotting the mis-indentation:

![ERB Footer](http://i.imgur.com/FvQgpes.png)

If we refresh the page now, we'll get a gallery full of broken images. How _a-paw-ling_! In order to see our adorable cats, we replace the `img` element with our ERB `image_tag`.

![ERB Images](http://i.imgur.com/UbtzopX.png)

Refresh the page! __Kittens!__

![Cat Gallery](http://i.imgur.com/LDAJYxC.png)

BUT. Our kittens are still named "Corporate Identity". That's not a great name for one kitten, let alone many. So let's replace "Corporate Identity" with the identifier `Cat <%= cat.id %>`.

![ERB Names](http://i.imgur.com/8NxEOJS.png)

Now, we can hover over our kittens in the gallery to get their IDs!

### Filters

Now that the gallery is functioning properly, we can add filters. Let's copy the `<div class="row">` element, and paste it inside `<div class="container">`, before the `each` loop.

![Filters](http://i.imgur.com/VWA4FHn.png)

The theme's filters now show up in the browser. Let's modify them for our cats!

![Demo Filters](http://i.imgur.com/2pm12G7.png)

The `data-filter` in each filter corresponds with the class name in our portfolio items. So, adding a filter with `data-filter=".animated"` means that clicking on it will keep all elements with the class `animated`.

![Animated Filters](http://i.imgur.com/pqduxoC.png)

So, let's use ERB to add a class name of `animated` to each `cat` list item where `cat.animated` is true.

![Animated ERB](http://i.imgur.com/QrU2nt6.png)

Now, if we click on the "Animated" filter, we'll get some cat GIFs!

### Purr-fect – hooray!
